#By: Broderick Lemke
#Libraries: P5.js
#Project Name: GameOfLife
#Project Goal: To explore Conway's Game of Life
#Current Status: Not being worked on. Part of a computer crash.
#Future Possibilities: There are logic errors in here. It is evident in the glider example, the glider stops eventually, and random points hang over. Based of experiences, I probably confused the two dimensional grid at some point and it needed to be updated. Another artifact that shows a bug is random pixels that hang on the edge of the screen.
